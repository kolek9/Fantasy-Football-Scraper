# Fantasy-Football-Scraper
Web Scraper to gather and manipulate fantasy football data 

Hoping to add an AI feature to start a league with

Some ideas:
 - Feed data over the season
 - Add height, weight, speed, jumping, etc. 
 - Possibly compare the performances of each column to the averages, assigning positive scores to those above the median, and negative to those below
    - or, use the ranks already provided. Performances will be more accurate, especially with gaps (2500 rush yards in first compared to 1200 second seems it should be a bigger differance than 1 point)
 - ! Need to add positive or negative traits to the columns already in there (less interceptions thrown by QB - good despite lower number)
